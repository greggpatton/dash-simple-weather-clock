### I used the excellent [Visual Crossing Global Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) for the weather information.

### Thanks to Adam and his awesome YouTube channel, [Charming Data](https://www.youtube.com/c/CharmingData/featured), for his very helpful [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) tutorials.

### I deployed this app to Heroku if you would like to see it live. You will need to get your own free API key from [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) to use it.  The API key and location are permanently stored in browser cookies. You can see the cookie code in settings.py.

### Enter your API key and a location then click or tap on the title to see the time and weather.
